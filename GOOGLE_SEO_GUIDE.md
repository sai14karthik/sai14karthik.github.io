## Steps to Get Indexed by Google

### Step 1: Verify Your Website is Live

1. Make sure your site is accessible at: **https://sai14karthik.github.io/skportfolio/**
2. Test it in an incognito/private browser window to ensure it's publicly accessible

### Step 2: Submit to Google Search Console (IMPORTANT!)

**Google Search Console** is the official tool to submit your website to Google.

#### 2.1 Create a Google Account (if you don't have one)
- Go to: https://accounts.google.com/signup
- Use your email: nsai14karthik@gmail.com

#### 2.2 Add Your Property to Search Console
1. Go to: **https://search.google.com/search-console**
2. Click **"Add Property"**
3. Select **"URL prefix"**
4. Enter your website URL: `https://sai14karthik.github.io/skportfolio/`
5. Click **"Continue"**

#### 2.3 Verify Ownership
Google will ask you to verify that you own the website. Choose one of these methods:

**Option A: HTML Tag (Easiest)**
1. Copy the HTML tag Google provides
2. Add it to your `index.html` in the `<head>` section
3. I can help you add this tag if needed

**Option B: HTML File Upload**
1. Download the HTML verification file Google provides
2. Upload it to your GitHub repository root
3. Commit and push it

**Option C: Domain Name Provider** (if you have a custom domain)

#### 2.4 Submit Your Sitemap
Once verified:
1. In Search Console, go to **"Sitemaps"** (left sidebar)
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click **"Submit"**

### Step 3: Request Indexing (Fast Track)

After verification:
1. In Search Console, go to **"URL Inspection"** (top search bar)
2. Enter your URL: `https://sai14karthik.github.io/skportfolio/`
3. Click **"Request Indexing"**
4. This tells Google to crawl your page immediately (usually within 24-48 hours)

### Step 4: Build Backlinks (Improve Ranking)

The more places that link to your site, the higher it will rank:

1. **Update Your LinkedIn Profile**
   - Add your website URL: https://sai14karthik.github.io/skportfolio/
   - Link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-karthik-n-a6aba234b/

2. **Update Your GitHub Profile**
   - Add website to your GitHub profile README
   - Pin the `skportfolio` repository

3. **Update Your Google Scholar Profile**
   - Add your website URL to your Scholar profile
   - Link: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HtJ7Q64AAAAJ&hl=en

4. **Share on Social Media**
   - Post about your portfolio on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
   - Each share creates a potential backlink

### Step 5: Wait for Indexing

- **Initial indexing**: 1-7 days after submission
- **Appearing in search results**: 1-4 weeks
- **Ranking improvement**: 2-6 months (with backlinks and content updates)

### Step 6: Monitor Your Progress

1. Check Search Console regularly for:
   - Indexing status
   - Search queries that found your site
   - Click-through rates
   - Any errors

2. Test your search:
   - Search: `"Sai Karthik Nallamothu"`
